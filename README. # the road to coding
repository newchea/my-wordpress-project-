  <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.6;">
    My journey with GitHub began out of curiosity and a desire to understand how developers collaborate on real projects. 
    At first, I didnâ€™t know what a repository was or how commits worked. But I was determined to learn.
  </p>
  <p style="color: #555; line-height: 1.6;">
    I started by creating my first repository, uploading an index.html file, and learning how to push changes using Git. 
    Slowly, I began to understand how version control works and how powerful GitHub can be for sharing and improving code.

    Today, GitHub is not just a tool â€” it's part of my daily learning. Whether Iâ€™m practicing HTML/CSS, building pages, or exploring new features, GitHub is helping me grow step by step.
